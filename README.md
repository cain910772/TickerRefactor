				Arbitrage
My midstone solves an issue that I have with trading cryptocurrencies. There are many , many crypto exchanges where blockchain based assets are traded. Due to the amount of available places to purchase coins, one of the ways a trader can take advantage of this is called arbitrage. Often a particular asset is trading higher on one exchange than another. The only way to currently see that is to go to those sites and view each pair individually. My App’s aim is to use Coin Market Caps API as well as the Cryptocompare API to find the top one-hundred assets value per each of the top exchanges and allow the user to view arbitrage opportunities. Also to allow the user to select specific coins to follow based on the user’s individual portfolio.

App will be built using React, React Bootstrap, React Dom, React Router and other packages that I may find and list at a later time. App will use the Coin Market Cap and Cryptocompare Api’s The Apps MVP will consist of the ability of the user to login, view data on any coin of their choice on an exchange of their choice and select individual assets to follow base on their portfolio.

The project will be based on the following ERD:

Stretch Goals:

The App’s stretch goals are to compare currency prices for the end user and present those with the biggest trading opportunities on screen after login.

Also to create a section that allows users to enter their portfolio holdings and track in USD what total value is.

My apps stretch goals are to allow a user to select whichever currency they desire and track the different prices on different exchanges so they can make money off of the differences based on arbitrage.
